Simple Rule-Based Chatbot (Python)

This is a basic rule-based chatbot written in Python.
It responds to simple predefined user inputs like "hello", "how are you", and "bye" using conditional statements.

 
  How It Works

The chatbot:

1. Greets the user.
2. Waits for input.
3. Converts the user’s input to lowercase.
4. Matches the input with predefined responses.
5. Replies accordingly.
6. Exits when the user types "bye".


How to Run

1. Save the script as chatbot.py
2. Open a terminal or command prompt
3. Run:
python chatbot.py


 Example Interaction

Chatbot: Hello! I’m your friendly chatbot. Type 'bye' to exit.

You: hello
Chatbot: Hi there!

You: how are you
Chatbot: I'm fine, thanks! How about you?

You: bye
Chatbot: Goodbye! Have a great day!
